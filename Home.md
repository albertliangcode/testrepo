// TODO - Add note about where to go with questions / concerns (Slack? IRC? Other?)

Welcome to the Stanford Applied Cybersecurity - Ret2Co hackathon!

To get started, check out the the [Setting Up Your Development Environment](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment) and [Using Angler to Identify Security Issues](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Using-Angler-to-Identify-Security-Issues) pages. They'll give you all of the context and tooling you'll need to tackle security issues throughout the hackathon. Once you have your dev environment setup, it's time get started on known issues within the Open Source community.

We've already setup a few projects for you to hack on. Check out the [Open Source Security Projects](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Open-Source-Security-Projects) list. For each of the listed projects, we've already forked them to the [returntocorp-hackathon](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon) Github organization and setup Angler. This will allow you to submit PRs and have Angler analyze them to make sure the issue has been resolved.

Happy hacking!
