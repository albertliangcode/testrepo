// TODO - Add note about where to go with questions / concerns (Slack? IRC? Other?)

Welcome to the Stanford Applied Cybersecurity - Ret2Co Hackathon!

To get started:

1. Read [Setting Up Your Development Environment](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment)
2. Try the [Using Angler to Identify Security Issues](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Using-Angler-to-Identify-Security-Issues) tutorial

These two pages will give the context and tooling you'll need to tackle security issues throughout the hackathon.

We've forked a few open source projects and setup Angler to run on PR submissions to them. Check out the [Open Source Security Projects](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Open-Source-Security-Projects) list to learn more about the projects and known issues.

Happy hacking!
