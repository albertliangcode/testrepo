// TODO - Add note about where to go with questions / concerns (Slack? IRC? Other?)

Welcome to the Stanford Applied Cybersecurity - Ret2Co hackathon!

# Getting Started

1. Read [Setting Up Your Development Environment](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment)
2. Do the [Using Angler to Identify Security Issues](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Using-Angler-to-Identify-Security-Issues) tutorial

The two above pages will give you all of the context and tooling you'll need to tackle security issues throughout the hackathon.

# Contributing Security Fixes

We've already setup a few projects for you to hack on. Check out the [Open Source Security Projects](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Open-Source-Security-Projects) list. For each of the listed projects, we've already forked them to the [returntocorp-hackathon](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon) Github organization and setup Angler. This will allow you to submit PRs and have Angler analyze them to make sure the issue has been resolved.

Happy hacking!
