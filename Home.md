Welcome to the Stanford Applied Cybersecurity - Ret2Co Hackathon!

To get started:

1. Read [Setting Up Your Development Environment](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment)
2. Try the [Using Angler to Identify Security Issues](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Using-Angler-to-Identify-Security-Issues) tutorial
3. Check out the [Open Source Security Projects](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Open-Source-Security-Projects) page to get started hacking. We forked several open source projects and setup Angler to run when you submit pull requests to them.

If you have any questions or experience issues, find us on Slack at **[TODO]**.

Happy hacking!
