// TODO - Add note about where to go with questions / concerns (Slack? IRC? Other?)

Welcome to the Stanford Applied Cybersecurity - Ret2Co Hackathon!

To get started:

1. Read [Setting Up Your Development Environment](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment)
2. Try the [Using Angler to Identify Security Issues](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Using-Angler-to-Identify-Security-Issues) tutorial

These two pages will give the context and tooling you'll need to tackle security issues throughout the hackathon.

We forked several open source projects and setup Angler to run when you submit pull requests to them. Check out the [Open Source Security Projects](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/hackathon002/wiki/Open-Source-Security-Projects) page to learn more and to get started hacking.

If you have any questions or experience issues, find us on Slack at [TODO].

Happy hacking!
