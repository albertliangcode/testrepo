### [Redis](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/redis)
Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. The data model is key-value, but many different kind of values are supported: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, HyperLogLogs, Bitmaps. There is a lot of C and should be a good project to get started with

### [HAProxy](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/haproxy)
HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. 100% C project that is used by a TON of tech companies and should be very hardened.

### [SQLlite](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/sqlite)
A very well tested C project so it should be easy to make sure your fixes work

### [SciPy](https://github.com/returntocorp-hackathon/scipy)
While python is a memory-safe language, a lot of key dependencies that are used by popular projects have bindings to Fortran, C, C++ where the memory-safety guarantees are no longer true.
